                No being able to fit in meant that Jakob had to spent an awfull amount of time alone.
                Most of his social interaction came from characters that he invented in his head.
                He would lie in his own bed imagining teams of adventures that he joined on magical quests in far away lands.
                Watching movies and reading comic books would help him create the characters he would interact with and the places he would go to.

                Growing up you are indoctrinated to let go of your imagination and instead memorize what someone else did or said.
                Being insecure as Jakob was he of course could not resist this social pressure 
                but his fantasy kept nagging in the back of his head yelling at him "Let me roam free! Let me take you away from this wretched place".
                This constant noise made it very difficult to learn anything which proved growing up a big challenge.
                In the end he was just waiting to escape. There had to be a better place somewhere.

            <p>
                As soon as Jakob was old enough he ran away. 
                He ventured out on an amazing bike ride with a fellow escapee and saw most of Europe on this 5200 km long adventure.
                They were suddenly free. Free from the shackles of social etiquette. 
                Free from the pressure to become someone they did not want to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this new freedom Jakob had to start defining his own path 
                but he had held back his creativity for so long that it had started to fade away.
                Now he had to embark on a journey to regain what he had lost. 
                Something that had once been his most treasured possesion.
