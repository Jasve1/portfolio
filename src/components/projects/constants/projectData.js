All the 3D meshes I made in Blender and for the background I used a free asset made by Dogmatic. I created the game out of frustration for this whole corona situation. I just wanted to destroy stuff and was inspired by the feeling of senseless destruction that is also present in a game like Cell Damage or GTA. The spiders in the game represent all the bad thoughts in my brain.',
